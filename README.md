# TattLab

## Key Features
- Interactive 3D arm model for tattoo visualization
- Upload and position tattoo designs in real-time
- User-friendly interface for easy experimentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Front-end: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
3D Rendering: Three.js
Back-end: Flask

## Development Process
We developed the web application using Three.js to render a 3D model of a human arm. The front-end was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience. The back-end, powered by Flask, handles rendering of the page and overall backbone of the project allowing for our team to develop the project while testing.

## Accomplishments
- Successful implementation of a real-time 3D tattoo visualization interface
- Seamless integration of image uploads and interactive positioning
- Overcoming technical challenges in 3D rendering for realistic tattoo representation

## Future Plans
1. Add more customization features:
- Different arm models
- Various skin tones
- Preview tattoos under different lighting conditions
2. Implement a save-and-share feature for design feedback
